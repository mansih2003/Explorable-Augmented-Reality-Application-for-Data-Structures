#### Introduction

1. The data structure course is the most essential and critical course for computing-related majors because it is one of the fundamental courses that needs to be taken by students.
2. However, learning data structures and understanding the performance effects of  distinct data structures on the same problem can be challenging. Mostly, students  change their majors if they are not successful in this course in their first attempt.
3. Our approach combines real-world environment with virtualization by using Augmented Reality (AR), and then we observe the effects of AR by comparing AR-based  visualization approach with the pure lecturing and lecturing with animations. 
4. AR is defined in as “3D virtual objects are integrated into a 3D real environment in real-time”. The objective is to develop AR visualization contents for data structures and analyse the effects of AR-based visualization and animation techniques for teaching data structures course
5. I've developed an AR application that visualizes some operations of data structures such as Array list, Linked list, and Stack. In order to develop an AR application, we have followed AR requirements such as integration of virtual objects or environment into the real environment; and real-time interactivity of the virtual and real objects at the same time
